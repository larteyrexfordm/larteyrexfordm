I am a computer science student, ctf player and a passionate cybersecurity | Pentesting enthusiast. 
I believe no system cannot be <b>broken</b>, I just have to <b>try</b> harder or maybe approach it differently. I have no muscles for battles, but cybersecurity is my own small way to save the <b>WORLD</B>.

## My Objective
This portfolio is to share my nights of coding, breaking into systems and solving CTFs, together with me, let's watch the codes flood the terminals and dance to Our tunes of VICTORY. I aim to provide writeups, codes and every goodies I got for every cybersecurity enthusiast.
